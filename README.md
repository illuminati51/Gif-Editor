# Gif-Editor

### What is it?
Gif Editor is a photo editor designed specifically for GIFs. The Gif Editor splits the GIF up into frames, and puts it in an
intuitive and easy to use style. It works just like any other photo editor, except that you can go back and forth between frames, and
save your final product as a GIF.

### How To
If you want to run the most recent version of the Gif Editor, download the folder Gif_Editor_Compiled, and run Gif_Editor.exe. Keep
in mind that the development is not complete, and many features are missing. If you want to see the features arrive sooner feel free to 
help me in the development of the Gif Editor!

### Request Features
If there is a specific feature you want added, feel free to add an issue letting me know the feature. I am constantly trying to come up with new features, and your input would help!

### Using On Your Website
Feel free to integrate the GIF Editor into your website. Although it is not required, letting people know I made the GIF Editor, and possibly giving a link to my Github would be really appreciated!
